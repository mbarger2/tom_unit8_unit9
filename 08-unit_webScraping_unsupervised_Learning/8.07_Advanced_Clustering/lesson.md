# Lesson 8.7 Advanced Clustering

### Lesson Duration: 3 hours

> Purpose: This is an _advanced clustering_ session, where we will give some additional tools to students to improve the clustering of their songs.

---

### Learning Objectives:

After this lesson, students will be able to:

- Ponder the weaknesses and strengths of several clustering algorithms (`K-Means`, `DBSCAN`, `Gaussian Mixtures`,...)
- Implement them using Python
- Use clustering as a preprocessing step in Supervised Learning

---

### Teacher material:

- [Clustering algorithms with Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/clustering-algorithms-with-python/)
