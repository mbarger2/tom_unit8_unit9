# Unit 8 - Advanced Data gathering techniques & Unsupervised Machine Learning

**In this Unit, students are going to create a whole data pipeline to recommend songs using Web Scraping, APIs and clustering methods**. For that, we'll be going through the basics of Web Applications (HTML documents, JSON files...) to understand how to select and retrieve data from websites and APIs. We'll also introduce Unsupervised Learning - focusing on clustering methods and especially on the K-Means algorithm.

**The aim of this unit is to supercharge their capabilities as data engineers, as they'll need to tie code together from data collection to modelling.** Also, the whole project is contextualized in a business setting in which they have to understand a company's needs and strategy - and get shit done. We'll wrap it up with delivering an engaging presentation, including data storytelling to be more persuasive. 

### By the end of this unit, students will be able to:

1. Use clustering algorithms to create groups of similar songs. 
    - Interpret the intuition of the algorithm.
    - Change the parameters of the algorithm, including the number of clusters, combining business and technical criteria.
2. Apply web scraping to gather original data from the web using beautiful soup
3. Use APIs to gather data from other services / products that make it available 
4. Create functions and scripts that tie different pieces of code together in a functional data pipeline.
5. Perform agile project management to ensure satisfactory results
6. Apply storytelling to their presentations to boost audience engagement
7. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to identify trends and propose different business scenarios
