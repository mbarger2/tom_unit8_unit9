## Session 2: The Audience & The Big Idea

> :clock10: 5 min
> Learning Activities:

### Key Concepts

- The Audience
- The Big Idea

Understanding your audience is vital to creating a narrative that helps you persuade them to take action. Some guiding questions to ask yourself:

- Who is your audience?
- What role do they play?
- Why should they care about your presentation?
- What would they like to achieve from your insights?
- What questions might they have?

These will help you determine how much information you need to share so that your data directly answers business goals and creates actionable insights.

**The Big Idea** is a concept that can help you get clear and concise on the main message we want to communicate your audience. It has three components:
It must articulate your unique point of view;
It must convey what's at stake; and
It must be a complete sentence.

##### Example:

> "The pilot summer learning program aimed at improving students' perception of science was successful and, because of the success, we recommend continuing to offer it going forward; please approve our budget for this program."
