# Unit 9 - Final Project
ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ @Himanshu we'll check this next week ;) 

**This is the end of the Bootcamp and the beginning of your career in Data Analitycs!** Students will complete a full-circle Data Analysis project going through all the process and applying what we've studied in the course. We'll provide them with 20 different datasets to work with or they can propose their own preference according to their goals. 

**The students will choose their challenge and present a plan**:

- They will scope the work they can do in one unit
- They will strategically choose the project to include in their portfolio
- They will self-manage throughout the process to present the project to an external jury.
- They will present the project professionally in front of a technical // non-technical audience.
- They will describe the methods used in the project and provide documentation to make the work accessible.

### **After this unit, students will be able to:**

1. Apply agile Project Management to deliver results
    - Use a Kanban Board to self-manage their projects
    - Prioritize project features/milestones to ensure value delivery
    - Define the project strategically, using a lean approach
2. Present a professional project
    - Produce documentation to make the project accessible
    - Present your project to an audience, accommodating your script to constraints (time, audience, etc.)
    - Build engaging presentations
    - Include storytelling to their presentations
3. Go through the whole Data Analysis process on their own, without much support. 
4. Use Python, SQL, Tableau and other tools to engineer the project. 
    - ...
5. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis 
    - Fit the model
    - Check accuracy of the model (exploring *Variance vs. Bias* tradeoff)
    - Iterate on the model to get more optimized results.
6. Write a case study on their work throughout the bootcamp and in this project.
